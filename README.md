Hello-World
===========

My first repository with github


Hi there chief,

So I'm just getting started in programming and I could really use some help learning my way around on github. Heck I'm not even sure if I should be using github at this stage of learning how to program but why not right? Just gonna dive right on in and learn how to program like a pro, one thing through I want to learn how to program in Objective C or C# so I can start making apps for the iphones and possibly androids. Can I do that on here? If so how?

With respects,

The big man
