Learning-to-code-in-objectiveC
===========


Hi there chief,

So I'm just getting started in programming and I could really use some help learning my way around on github. Heck I'm not even sure if I should be using github at this stage of learning how to program but why not right? Just gonna dive right on in and learn how to program like a pro, one thing through I want to learn how to program in Objective C or C# so I can start making apps for the iphones and possibly androids. Can I do that on here? If so how?

So let's start this all off at the beginning, what is Objective C?

By the power of wikipedia and ctrl-c ctrl-v, we have a quick and dirty answer:

Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

The programming language Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS X and iOS are derived.[2] Generic Objective-C programs that do not use the Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or those using parts that may be ported or reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GCC or Clang.

Objective-C source code program files usually have .m filename extensions, while Objective-C header files have .h extensions, the same as for C header files. Objective-C++ files are denoted with a .mm file extension.

So what is the structure of a program? What is the most basic architecture that is necessary for the program to work?








With respects,

The big man
